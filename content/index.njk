          As you learn how to analyse a website design, one of the first
          things you discover is that it's more time-consuming repair
          older sites. In almost every case, it's better to build a new
          website from scratch, particularly if you built your site some
          time ago. The Internet is constantly changing, and the way
          people search for content as well as the way search engines
          treat it is always evolving as well. As a result, building from
          the ground up is almost always a good idea.

          Yes. We like to offer the ability for our clients to update
          their website themselves. All necessary training and tools to be
